      "Fecha: 2025-12-08T12:19:08Z\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A GlobalData survey has found the leading trigger for purchasing cyber insurance is being advised by a broker. In an SME insurance market where low awareness and under-insurance continue to widen the cyber protection gap, cyber insurance is increasingly being recognised by industry experts as a major growth opportunity. Meanwhile, CFC Underwriting Limited (CFC) has launched a new tool to help brokers explain cyber risk in clear commercial terms and close the SME cyber protection gap.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to GlobalData’s 2025 UK SME Insurance Survey, 26.7% of SMEs purchased cyber insurance because they were advised by a broker to do so. This finding underscores the central role of broker-led distribution in driving cyber insurance uptake among smaller businesses, where trust in intermediaries and clear explanation of coverage are often decisive factors in purchasing decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, CFC has launched a new Cyber Threat Review tool designed to help brokers communicate cyber risk in clear commercial terms and bridge the SME cyber protection gap. The tool provides tailored insights into a business’s specific cyber exposures, translating complex technical vulnerabilities into practical business risks such as financial loss, operational disruption, and reputational damage. According to GlobalData’s 2025 UK SME Insurance survey, 40.4% of SMEs think it is unlikely their company will be a target of a cyberattack and 9.2% have not even heard about it. By reframing conversations away from technical terminology and towards tangible commercial impact, CFC aims to improve understanding and purchasing confidence among SMEs that may previously have viewed cyber insurance as non-essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rollout of the tool highlights the value of embedding risk intelligence into the distribution process. By equipping brokers with business-specific cyber risk assessments at the point of sale, CFC reduces the friction that has traditionally discouraged SMEs from engaging with cyber insurance. The launch of this cyber tool offers a clear example of how insurance providers can use technology-enabled advisory capabilities to close the SME cyber protection gap. In doing so, it enhances broker effectiveness, improves SME awareness of cyber exposures, and supports sustainable growth in a historically under-penetrated line of business.\n",

      "Fecha: 2025-12-08T12:28:00Z\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This story was originally published onPackaging Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free dailyPackaging Dive newsletter.\n",
      "\n",
      "South Africa-based Sappi Ltd. and Finland-based UPM-Kymmene Corp. announced their intention to combine forces in their European business units toform a joint venturefor graphic paper worth an estimated 1.42 billion euros, $1.65 billion. The deal includes a mill in the United States and has broader implications for the North American market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The companies say they already havesigned a non-binding agreement, plan to sign definitive agreements in the first half of 2026 and expect the deal to close by the end of next year, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The independent JV would not be listed on a stock exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed venture is intended to boost profitability while the European graphic paper industry experiences a “sustained structural decline in demand” in addition to overcapacity and low utilization rates, according to a Sappinews release. Other conditions contributing to market deterioration include rising input costs as well as trade and tariff stress. Wood and energy costs, in particular, have gone up since Russia’s war in Ukraine began, said Sappi CEO Steve Binnie on a Dec. 4 investor call about the transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two companies’ leaders say the JV would provide a way to boost resilience while offering customers long-term supply security.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We've looked at many options over the years, and we believe that consolidation, rationalization of the industry, makes a lot of sense and it creates better balance,” Binnie said during the call. “The business that we're going to be creating will be more stable, more resilient and adaptable to the dynamics in the environment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The new UPM will have, or will see, improved profitability, a stronger balance sheet, a lower leverage and a much stronger growth-oriented portfolio,” said Massimo Reynaudo, president and CEO of UPM, during a separate Dec. 4 investor webcast about the transaction. “The joint venture will have products basically serving all the needs of the graphic paper industry. ... From a geographical standpoint, it will be a global business,” although the focal point is in Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operational synergies upon completion of the deal are expected to total at least 100 million euros ($116.5 million) annually, while achieving greater profitability and stronger cash-flow generation compared to what the companies could achieve on their own. Sappi’s business is valued at 320 million euros ($372.7 million) and UPM’s is valued at 1.1 billion euros ($1.28 billion).\n",
      "\n",
      "Three years after the deal closes, either company will have the option to divest their share of the JV, said UPM CFO Tapio Korpeinen, during the company’s investor call.\n",
      "\n",
      "BothSappiandUPMalso have numerous locations in the United States that are not directly part of the proposed JV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sappi and UPM would both have a 50% stake in the JV, which would operate separately as an independent company. The companies say the new business’ structure would reallocate production volumes toward the most efficient paper machines, which would increase performance and utilization rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the deal, Sappi wouldcontribute four millsand UPM would contribute eight:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sappi:Gratkorn Mill in Austria; Ehingen Mill in Germany; Maastricht Mill in the Netherlands; Kirkniemi Mill in Finland; plus European wood supply joint ventures.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPM communication papers assets at the following mills:Augsburg, Schongau, and Nordland paper lines 1 and 4 in Germany; Kymi, Rauma and Jämsänkoski paper line 6 in Finland; Caledonian in the United Kingdom; and Blandin in Grand Rapids, Minnesota.\n",
      "\n",
      "These included sites make up less than 10% of UPM’s total assets, Korpeinen said on UPM’s call. After the transaction,about 20% of Sappi’s volumes will be in graphic paper, Binnie said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Executives for both companies noted the deal will also enhance their sustainability efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European graphic paper industry has been under pressure for about 20 years due to factors such as digitization and the decline in printed newspapers. Beyond just the Minnesota mill moving to the JV, the proposed changes under this deal also could impact the broader U.S. fiber market and other U.S.-based companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The North American graphic paper business remains integral to our strategy. That market is in balance,” Binnie said on Sappi’s call.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a Dec. 5 note to investors from Michael Roxland, senior paper and packaging analyst at Truist Securities, the JVcould be positive for Packaging Corporation of America and Sylvamo, which are the third-and second-largest North American producers of uncoated freesheet, respectively; Sylvamo would become the third-largest producer in Europe if the UPM-Sappi deal goes through.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European uncoated freesheet market exports approximately 500,000mt to North America annually, Roxland said. Exports to the U.S. could decline if the JV partners rationalize their assets, he noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, U.S. uncoated freesheet producers could “benefit from potential closures of coated paper capacity as European coated paper producers have the ability to grade switch to uncoated paper by lifting their coaters,” according to Roxland.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The work we are doing now will ensure that we are going to be capturing our fair share, or more than our fair share, of the growth that will come when the economic cycle will turn,” Reynaudo said during the investor presentation.\n",

      "Fecha: 2025-12-08T12:09:33Z\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Dec 8 (Reuters) - U.S. utility company NextEra Energy has expanded its partnership with Alphabet's Google Cloud to build new energy supplies for the company's operations across the U.S., the groups said on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "NextEra and Google currently have ​3.5 gigawatts of electricity generation - enough to power about 2.5 million homes - in operation or contracted.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of the new deal, ‌the companies will develop multiple new large-scale data center campuses in the U.S. that will be built with new power plants. They did not specify how much extra capacity ‌would be added, or financial details of the agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "NextEra shares were down 1% by 1722 GMT, having risen in premarket trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agreement comes as U.S. electricity demand reaches record highs from the proliferation of data centers needed to train and roll outartificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without enough supplies readily available on the existing grid, giant technology companies are contracting to build new electricity sources to power their AI data center expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are positioning our company around bring-your-own-generation, ⁠and we are uniquely positioned to win this,\" NextEra ‌CEO John Ketchum said at an investor conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "NextEra and Google Cloud also plan to launch an AI-powered product by mid-2026 that will help manage work in the field, predicting energy equipment problems and other functions aimed at ‍increasing the reliability of the grid, the companies said.\n",
      "\n",
      "NextEra said it expects to add 15 gigawatts, or possibly much more, of new power generation for data centers by 2035.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also to serve that demand, NextEra will partner with ExxonMobil to develop natural-gas-fired power plants for data centers that use carbon capture technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plans with Exxon include ​an initial 1.2-gigawatt gas plant, which would be jointly marketed to data centers, that would be located near the oil major's carbon ‌dioxide-carrying pipeline in the Southeast U.S., NextEra said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In October, NextEra announced that it would restart its shut Duane Arnold nuclear power plant in Iowa to power Google data centers under a 25-year power purchase contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "The technology industry's quest for massive amounts of electricity for AI processing has renewed interest in nuclear power supply, which includes restarting fully shut reactors, expanding the capacity of operating plants, and contracting for electricity from future small modular reactors.\n",
      "\n",
      "That electricity demand has also propelled the development of natural-gas-fired power, which is quicker to build than nuclear, but ⁠produces global warming emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "NextEra said it expects to announce new natural-gas-fired power deals for ​data centers in 12–24 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "NextEra said it had also signed 11 power purchase agreements ​and two energy storage agreements with Meta Platforms, totaling over 2.5 GW of energy contracts. The projects are scheduled to come online between 2026 and 2028.\n",
      "\n",
      "The utility has also reached an agreement with WPPI Energy to continue supplying 168 ‍megawatts of the output from the ⁠Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Two Rivers into the 2050s.\n",
      "\n",
      "NextEra forecast higher adjusted profit in 2026 as well as the current year as it continues to benefit from the power demand surge.\n",

      "According to aU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filingdated November 14, HGI Capital Management sold out its entire holding of Kite Realty Group Trust during the third quarter. The transaction amounted to an estimated $3.4 million based on quarterly average prices. The exit comes as the fund is undergoing a substantial reduction in its total reportable U.S. equity holdings.\n",
      "\n",

      "A sweeping repositioning away from a crop of office and retail REITs is taking shape across HGI’s portfolio, and the full exit from Kite Realty Group underscores how dramatically the fund might be rethinking exposure to structurally challenged real estate. For those curious, the move highlights a broader question: Even with improving fundamentals, is the multi-year reset in such REITs enough to offset a decade-long erosion in equity value?Kite’s fundamentals did show progress in thelatest quarter, giving the sale added weight. The company raised its 2025 funds from operations guidance and delivered same-property net operating income growth of 2.1% while bringing blended cash leasing spreads up 18.9% year-over-year. Core FFO reached $116.3 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, and retail occupancy ticked up to 93.9% — notable resilience given macro pressure on discretionary retail.

      "Looking at long-term performance of the S&P 500, you might wonder why you wouldn't just invest your entire 401(k) in it. The numbers are compelling: The index hasaveraged about 10.5% per yearhistorically, and its returns in recent years have been even stronger.\n",

      "Do you have a financial question you want answered? Email AskAnAdvisor@smartasset.com orconnect with a financial advisorfor free using ourmatching tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer depends on where you are in your financial journey, whether you're still in the accumulation phase and building toward retirement or you're already in retirement and relying on your investments for income. In both cases, there are real advantages to owning the S&P 500. But there are also meaningful risks and blind spots that deserve attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "For investors in their 20s, 30s or even 40s, investing heavily in theS&P 500makes intuitive sense. Time is on your side, giving you the ability to weather market cycles and let compounding do its work in the decades before retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regular contributions to your 401(k) also provide a built-in advantage in the form ofdollar-cost averaging. By contributing a portion of each paycheck, you automatically buy more shares when prices are low and fewer when they're high. Over time, dollar-cost averaging helps smooth out volatility and removes emotion from the decision-making process. It's a disciplined, consistent approach that rewards and reinforces patience.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there's a difference between being thoughtfully aggressive and putting it all on red. Investing 100% of your 401(k) in the S&P 500 comes with some meaningful risks that aren't always obvious at first glance. (And if you need help selecting investments that align with your goals,speak with a financial advisor.)\n",
      "\n",
      "For most young investors, the first and most important question isn't whether you can bear the risk; it's whether you can stay the course when volatility arises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Market history provides some humbling reminders. The S&P 500 has experienced multiple periods of severe decline and years of flat or negative returns. These times are known as the “lost decades.” During the 2000s, for instance, investors who stayed fully invested in the index saw no real growth for 10 years. The same was true during parts of the 1970s and, on a more extreme scale, during the Great Depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even within an investor's lifetime, sharp market declines of 30%+ are inevitable. When those moments arrive, headlines are grim, jobs may be at risk and economic data may deteriorate.

      "On its surface, the S&P 500 appears broadly diversified. After all, it holds 500 companies across all major industries. But recent trends, investment themes and investor preferences have led the index to become much more concentrated than its name implies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, 10 stocks account for more than 30% of the index's overall weight and have driven about the same proportion of total returns over the past few years. When these companies (which are largely in the technology and communication services sectors) perform well, returns for the index look fantastic. But when they stumble, the entire index suffers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another layer of concentration comes from geographic exposure. The U.S. currently represents about half of the world's total investable market, an unusually high percentage compared to history. By investing solely in the S&P 500, you're effectively betting that U.S. companies will continue to outperform every other region indefinitely. Including exposure to international stocks and other asset classes can both reduce risk and potentially improve long-term outcomes without abandoning an equity-oriented approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "(And if you need help spreading your portfolio across different asset classes and regions,consider working with a financial advisor.)\n",
      "\n",
      "If the argument is whether you should invest in an asset that can potentially generate 10.5% annually, why not invest in something that has done even better? Over the past decade,Nvidiahas delivered incredible returns: Over 50% per year on average. So, why not put all of your money in Nvidia?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because that story cuts both ways. Between 2001 and 2002, Nvidia's stock fell 90%. Even over the past 15 years, it's seen four separate drawdowns of more than 30%. Would you have stayed invested through each extended downturn?\n",
      "\n",
      "While the S&P 500 is obviously more diversified than a single company, the behavioral challenge is similar. From 2000 to 2002, the index dropped about 47%, then it lost 50% only a few years later during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. Even diversified markets can test your conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diversification isn't about eliminating risk-it's about managing it. By holding other asset classes like bonds, international stocks or real assets, you consciously trade some upside for greater stability when volatility strikes, especially when you least expect it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you approach retirement, the conversation shifts. The question isn't just \"What will the market return?\" but \"What happens if the market drops when I need to make withdrawals?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This is known assequence of returns risk, and it can have lasting consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a retiree with a $2 million portfolio invested entirely in the S&P 500 who plans to withdraw $500,000 for a home purchase. If the market falls 50%, that portfolio drops to $1 million. Now, that same $500,000 withdrawal represents half the portfolio, not one quarter. To recover to its original value, the remaining $500,000 would need to quadruple. It could take decades to make a full recovery in a period of life when time isn't necessarily on your side.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why liquidity and diversification matter so much in retirement. Having access to lower-volatility assets for near-term needs allows the rest of the portfolio to recover and continue compounding. (Consider working with afinancial advisoras you approach and enter retirement.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The psychological challenges of investing don't disappear in retirement. If anything, they intensify. Without a regular paycheck, your portfolio becomes your sole source of income. During downturns like the COVID-19 selloff, many retirees felt immense pressure to move to cash as markets were near their lows. Those emotional decisions can have long-term costs that are difficult to recover from.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, staying too conservative can create its own problem: longevity risk, or the risk of outliving your money. With retirement potentially lasting 20 or 30 years, you still need growth to maintain purchasing power and keep pace withinflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solution isn't a binary choice between \"all stocks\" or \"no stocks.\" It's about matching your investments to your time horizon. For example, funds you'll need in the next 12–24 months can be set aside in lower-volatility assets like cash or short-term bonds, while longer-term funds remain invested for growth. (If you're looking for a personalized retirement investment plan that aligns with your timeline and comfort level,connect with a financial advisorfor free.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether you're just starting to build wealth or preparing to live off it, investing is always a balance between growth and protection. The S&P 500 has proven to be a powerful engine for long-term compounding, but even the best engine needs a stabilizer.\n",
      "\n",
      "A well-diversified portfolio doesn't mean sacrificing returns. It means smoothing the ride so you can stay invested through all types of market environments. By incorporating a mix of asset classes, aligning your risk with your time horizon, goals, assets and liabilities, and acknowledging the emotional side of investing, you give yourself the best chance to capture the market's long-term benefits without letting short-term volatility derail your plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, investing isn't about finding the \"perfect\" allocation; it's about finding the one you can stick with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many plans allow you to automate ongoing portfolio maintenance, which can reduce drift and keep your target allocation intact during volatile markets. If your plan offers a managed account option, it may provide more personalized allocation work than a standardtarget-date fund, though it's worth comparing any added fees to the service offered.\n",

      "\n",
      "I’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic.Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n",
      "\n",
      "OnThe Ramsey Show, Joy described how her husband allegedly shut her out of the business after she left following claims of abuse and control. She recounted that “He just… started taking over everything,” then accused her of embezzlement and blocked her access to bank accounts, payroll and building entry (1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the company remains a 50/50 LLC on paper, Joy no longer receives pay and has no operational control; she says she “can’t even get unemployment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Situations like Joy's are more common than you might think. Here’s what the Ramsey hosts had to Joy, and what others who share a business with their spouse can do to protect themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ramsey hosts didn’t mince words about Joy’s situation. After hearing she was a 50% owner who had been locked out of the business and left with just $2,500 a month, they told her the immediate problem wasn’t only budgeting, it was representation. “Your attorney sucks,” host Jade Warshaw said. “If this is the status quo, you need somebody else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They urged Joy to push harder for temporary financial protections rather than wait months for mediation. Because her income has disappeared while fixed expenses remain, the hosts said she needs a lawyer who will advocate for interim orders, challenge her exclusion from company operations or pay, and fight delays that leave her financially exposed. As Warshaw put it, Joy should have an attorney “that understands that you’re the one with the upper hand, not him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The hosts also stressed short-term survival: covering essentials, generating side income and preventing further financial erosion. But they made clear that no amount of budgeting will resolve the deeper issue. As George Kamel asked, “If you’re 50/50, you have just as much power as he has. So why is he holding all the cards?” Their advice underscores the broader lesson for high earners: when business and marriage mix, securing strong legal guidance early can be as critical as any financial plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hosts’ warnings point to a larger issue that affects many couples who build companies together: when your income is tied to both your spouse and your business structure, a breakup can quickly turn into a financial crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts note the sheer necessity of planning for a worst-case scenario. And as Mills Family Law warns, particularly, \"The breakup of a marriage or common-law relationship can have serious implications for a high-net-worth business.” (2) Without legal agreements governing what happens in a breakup (such as a prenuptial agreement, buy-sell agreement or operating agreement specifying controls and exit terms), one partner may end up with unilateral control simply by changing the day-to-day dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crucial lesson: treat a jointly owned business as a business, not just a marital asset. That means working with a lawyer to put legal safeguards in place from the very start.\n",
      "\n",
      "A formal operating agreement or shareholder agreement that defines decision-making authority, ownership rights and what happens in the event of separation or divorce\n",

      "\n",
      "Separate business and personal finances, and documentation of consistent compensation rather than reinvestment of all profits\n",
      "\n",
      "In some states, prenuptial or postnuptial agreements can further clarify these terms. Such agreements can’t guarantee outcomes, especially in contested divorces or abuse settings, but they do provide clear documentation that can help courts preserve fairness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read More: Here are the 5 market moves you can't ignore heading into 2026 — andwhat savvy investors are doing now to prepare\n",
      "\n",
      "While leaving because of alleged abuse alone doesn't automatically transfer business ownership or management to the other spouse, the outcome depends heavily on the business’s legal structure (LLC, partnership, corporation), state law and whether courts issue protective or asset-freezing orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "In many cases, courts treat businesses as marital property until the divorce is resolved and may delay major business decisions until assets are equitably divided.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, U.S. family courts can order a one-sided shift of business control (via a court-appointed “receiver”) when a marital business is at risk, even before final divorce resolution. For example, as Ladd Hirsch of Diamond McCarthy LLP points out, if one spouse “Is wrongfully taking assets of the business, e.g., directing the business to pay personal expenses.” (3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, the Michigan Bar Journal states, \"In divorce actions, receivers can be appointed to preserve marital property pending a property division,” particularly when a family business is involved and “management or control of the business is unclear.” (4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Joy’s situation shows how vulnerable high earners can become when a shared business and a marriage unravel at the same time. For many, getting guidance from a qualified professional before problems arise is the most reliable way to protect yourself if your personal and business worlds ever collide.\n",

      "Título: Conmed to exit gastroenterology business\n",
      "Fecha: 2025-12-08T12:32:24Z\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "US-based Conmed is exiting its gastroenterology business, reflecting the company’s aim to sharpen its focus on higher growth margin business lines as part of a broader portfolio optimisation strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The business anticipates that the exit will allow it to align both operations and resources on its core markets, including robotic and laparoscopic surgery, and orthopaedic soft tissue repair surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the announcement on 5 December, the company’s shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) fell by almost 10% to a $40.07 per share close, down from a $43.69 market open. Conmed has a market cap of $1.24bn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conmed’s gastroenterological business has previously been comprised of endoscopic accessories such as retrieval nets and tools such as general endoscopy consumables. However, the company’s flagship gastro product is W.L. Gore & Associates’ VIABIL biliary stent for treating blockages in bile ducts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conmed has held the exclusive distribution rights to Gore’s stent in the US and Canada since 2006. While Conmed previously announced in a Form 10-Q filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in November 2025 that it would not be renewing the agreement beyond 31 December 2026, the company has since moved to accelerate this timeline, now concluding the agreement by 1 January 2026.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the start of next year, Olympus Corporation will take over distribution responsibilities for Gore’s Viabil stent. In October 2025, W.L. Gore and Olympussigned a global distribution dealfor the stent. Terms of the agreement have not been publicly disclosed. According tothe Form 10-Q, distributing Gore’s stent represented $44.1m of Conmed’s sales in the nine months ended 30 September 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conmed’s CEO Patrick J Beyer commented: “By concentrating our resources on our core growth platforms, we are positioning Conmed for long-term success and continued leadership in surgical innovation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Products within Conmed’s gastro portfolio are expected to generate revenues in the $90m-$95m range in fiscal year 2025 (FY25), the company said, with the exit not expected to materially impact overall revenues for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon announcing the new strategy, Conmed reiterated its prior FY25 guidance range for revenue of around $1.37bn and earnings between $4.48 and $4.53 per share. As a result of the exit, Conmed expects an earnings per share dilution of $0.45–$0.55 in 2026.\n",

      "Fecha: 2025-12-08T12:00:00Z\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Jo Ann Switzer seems like the perfectly average 66-year-old enjoying a quiet retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "She ran a hair salon for 45 years, and lives alone in Hanover, Ontario, a small Canadian town of fewer than 8,000 people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can nowbecome a landlord for as little as $100— and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n",
      "\n",
      "Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake —here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic.Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n",
      "\n",
      "But in at least one respect, Switzer is anything but the typical retiree: She’s an avid cryptocurrency investor.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn’t somebody who has just put a few hundred dollars into Bitcoin and hoped for the best: Switzer is obsessed with crypto, in a manner one usually associates with young men in their 20s and 30s who work in finance or tech and follow Elon Musk on X.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knows about paying “gas fees” and has an account on Discord. In May, she made the three-hour trip to Toronto to attend an international crypto conference. Earlier this year, in January, she flew to Miami to be at Crypto Gathering 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was like everybody’s grandma,” she said. “There’s these sockless young guys with skinny pants … and there’s very few women.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She built a $14,000 portfolio in less than a year, holding a broad range of virtual currencies including Ethereum, Solana, Ondo, Sui and Polygon.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it hasn’t been easy. In fact, some of her most elementary lessons on buying crypto, like how to set up two-factor authentication and hot wallets, came from an unlikely source: scammers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early on in her journey, she was victimized in 2024 by four separate crypto scams that cost her $18,000 in total. But that didn’t deter her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Switzer’s story, though unique, helps explain why people of all ages and financial backgrounds have been drawn to the world of crypto for reasons that go beyond the simple pursuit of bottom-line returns. And her experience raises important questions about the lack of education for older investors in a world increasingly pervaded by digital money and related scams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Switzer’s crypto holdings make up a small portion of her overall portfolio, which mainly consists of real estate, she often checks her accounts twice a day and has an approach many would find thorough and clear-eyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m very cautious; meme coins hold no value for me,” she said. “I'm not interested in one hour. I'm not interested in just today.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She researches the use-case of coins before buying and looks at performance over a three- to six-month range. And she says she only buys when a price drops (she has alerts set).\n",
      "\n",
      "Every day she tunes in to live shows on social media where other investors discuss the market. One of her favorites isThe Rise Up Morning Show, which airs Monday to Thursday and is hosted by three men sitting at their computers at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I'm making my coffee or if I'm doing my dishes or I am scrubbing a floor, or I'm just, you know, sitting on the couch at night, I'll check to see who's live that I know I'm gonna learn something through,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has come a long way since last year, when she was first exposed to the technology on TikTok and began taking investing courses, on the education platform Real Vision, that she found to be “advanced” and “university level.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, she soon found herself in the crosshairs of predatory scammers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“First two were investment ones … which is you hire an investor and you send them money through your TFSA or your RSPs,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scammers showed her fake performance statistics of her investment. “And in order to get it out you have to put more in, you know. Gas fees!” she recalled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The next scam was a QFS scam … quantum financial whatever. … And again, rug pull,” she said. “And then the next one was a fictitious airdrop.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The scammers used some sophisticated tactics, at one point employing AI to create a fake video message from an influencer Switzer trusted. “He” even said her name.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what would have pushed most average people to swear off the space drove Switzer to keep going.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I get mad and just started listening and learning and doing it myself,” she said. “I’m stubborn. ‘Cause I’m going to make it back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It's sort of funny because the ones that gave me the most help, of course, and were the most patient, were the scammers,” said Switzer about her early learning period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once she realized she was being taken for a ride, she set out to extract as much crypto knowledge as possible — to get her “pound of flesh,” as she called it — from the scammers, who, because they were hoping to maximize the amount of money they could get out of her, were exceedingly generous with their time and expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They were at my beck and call. If I woke up in the middle of the night, I'd send them a question any hour, any day. I just bombarded them with questions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Switzer’s scamming experience, if not her response to it, is distressingly common. Last year, people over the age of 60 filed 8,043 complaints of cryptocurrency investment fraud, according to the FBI. Losses totaled $1.6 billion, and no other age group came close. [1]\n",
      "\n",
      "“Criminals introduce the topic of cryptocurrency and claim to have expertise, or an affiliation with experts, who can help potential investors achieve financial success,” said the FBI in a 2023 public service announcement. “Criminals then convince victims to use fraudulent websites or apps, controlled by the criminals, to invest in cryptocurrency. Criminals coach victims through the investment process, show them fake profits, and encourage victims to invest more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Although financial advisors may caution against any involvement with it, we know some seniors are interested in putting hard-earned money into these assets. And as they struggle to understand it, scammers are getting to them before the industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Studies show that most crypto owners tend to be below the age of 35 and male. Education resources designed for seniors, who are also arguably the most vulnerable to scams, are scarce. [2]\n",
      "\n",
      "CryptoLiteracy.org, an industry initiative, said its 2024 survey revealed “persistent gaps” in knowledge that “the industry must address to ensure equitable access and safe adoption.\" [3]\n",
      "\n",
      "By now, cryptocurrencies may have found their way into most retirement accounts through broad index funds that hold public companies like Coinbase and Microstrategy, but the assets are still complex and intimidating to most people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Switzer said she understands, from firsthand experience, the barriers that potential older crypto investors face: “They only know what they’ve been told, and whatever they’ve been told doesn’t make any sense. They don’t see a place to learn.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Read More: Here are the 5 market moves you can't ignore heading into 2026 — andwhat savvy investors are doing now to prepare\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Toronto conference in May, after the day’s sessions were over, Switzer went bowling with the group of young, male investors she had met online.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was very impressed with Jo when I met her,” said Daniel, 47, one of her crypto crew who uses the handle @cavemanfantassy on TikTok. “She’s always been somebody who’s very vocal, a very positive person in the community. She’s one of those go-getters, and I love those types of people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s clear, given Switzer’s brush with scammers and what happened afterward, that the crypto world is providing her something far beyond a mere investment opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Learning about developments in technology and feeling like part of a community seem to get her more excited than the potential monetary returns. She said it would be hard to find five people in her town who know anything about crypto, but the internet has brought her people from across the world to connect with over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She also likes that crypto is disconnected from governments and financial giants, which she doesn’t trust. She says she avoids stocks because they’re “all manipulated.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Evan Mann, the 34-year-old co-host ofThe Rise Up Morning Show, and a co-founder of crypto education company Rise Up Media, said his oldest listener is 83 and there are many in their 60s and 70s.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When they find us, a lot of people tell us it’s the first time they understood crypto,” said Mann.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A lot of our audience looks like [Switzer]. Somebody who maybe has retirement money that they want to take control over and invest. They want to get out of extractive relationships with banks and fund managers. Or maybe they’re looking for ways to stay abreast of technology or avoid scams and schemes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He added that people who feel isolated, especially older people, also seek connection online while they look to upskill themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Switzer said crypto-curious seniors should be set up with social media apps like TikTok, Discord and Instagram so they can start their learning journey. She recommends live events on these platforms as especially helpful. But, she said, skepticism and caution are paramount.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t think that if somebody reaches out to you that they’re anything but a scammer,” she said, advising that social media accounts should be set to private to avoid direct messages. “You don’t click on anything you don’t recognize.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She recommends using only the top exchanges and platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mann said he has noticed a troubling trend among retiree investors. It’s not a hesitancy around crypto despite warnings from advisers and experts, it’s quite the opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most people don’t have enough for retirement. Because of how they hear about crypto online, they see it as a get-rich-quick scheme,\" he said. \"A big part of my job is walking people back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Retirees should also understand there are big risks when putting money in volatile investments. There have also been numerous hacks and bad actors working within the industry, like Sam Bankman-Fried who was convicted of fraud after the collapse of his exchange, FTX.\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked about whether she fears a crypto crash, Switzer said no because “even the buildings that I invest in, my investments, they can all burn down. They can be flooded. They can end up losing all their tenants because of, you know, fleas.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironically, neither of Switzer’s children is interested in crypto. “I said, ‘Well you better hurry up and start learning,” she said, “because if anything happens to me, you got to know what to do with this.”\n",

      "After all, bets that the Fed will cut rates have helped the S&P 500 bounce back from AI woes and jump 5% since late November, so equity traders need Jerome Powell and co to deliver.\n",

      "A pause rather than a cut would come as a shock to markets. So the real focus will be on how many policymakers, who are looking increasingly divided, dissent from the decision. The Fed's decision-making committee has not had three or more dissents at a meeting since 2019 and even before that it was a rarity, happening just nine times since 1990.\n",

      "This week is not all about the Fed though, with central banks in Canada, Switzerland and Australia also meeting, though they're all expected to hold rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the focus was also on the European Central Bank on Monday, where Isabel Schnabel, a leading policy hawk, said Frankfurt's next move could be a rate hike rather than a cut as some expect, though it won't happen in the near future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Markets ⁠are now pricing a small probability of an ECB hike next year -- one they had priced out previously. Traders ​already expect rate hikes in Japan, Australia and Canada, moves that could put further pressure on the dollar if they materialise.\n",

      "In bond markets, Germany's 30-year bond yield rose to its highest level since 2011, in the latest sign that long-end debt pressures are building back ‍up. Japanese bond yields rose to fresh multi-year highs ⁠while U.S. 30-year Treasury yields touched their highest since September.\n",

First off, this rate cut is basically a done deal, so all eyes are on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's forward guidance and whether he'll signal more cuts in 2026.

However, we did not foresee the pause in offshore spending that started in 2024. We do not expect a resumption of spending until 2027 at the earliest. In the meantime, companies like Noble Energy trade at ~10x Free cash flow, which is simply not as cheap if your cost of debt is 8% and your assets have a limited life span.

      "Fecha: 2025-12-08T12:55:00Z\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social Security is a key income source for millions of retired Americans, and these benefits are taxed at the federal level.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thresholds at which taxes on benefits apply are very low: Benefits are taxed for seniors whose combined income (the total of adjusted gross income, non-taxable interest income and 50% of annual Social Security benefits) exceeds $25,000 at the individual level, or $32,000 at the joint tax-filing level. Although taxing retirement benefits may seem odd, the purpose of the taxes is clear: those funds ensure the future of the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "But President Donald Trump’s campaign promise, “Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security — and they won't,” was upheld in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July 2025, which introduced new tax deductions for seniors based on income eligibility — sort of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can nowbecome a landlord for as little as $100— and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n",

      "Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake —here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n",
      "\n",
      "Approaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n",
      "\n",
      "While the President has declared that Social Security benefits are now tax-free many times, the reality of what the Act actually allows is rather different. Senate budget reconciliation rules prevent sweeping changes to the Social Security program. What seniors will get is a temporary $6,000 tax deduction between 2025 and 2028 (1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, explains that this deduction is gradually phased out for taxpayers with incomes over $75,000, or $150,000 for married couples. Moreover, the $6000 reduction isn’t likely to benefit those who need it most: low-income retirees who already pay low or no taxes on their benefits (2).\n",
      "\n",
      "The reality is that completely eliminating taxes on Social Security could cause significant harm to the program. Here’s why.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social Security gets most of its funding from payroll tax revenue, according to the SSA, but the program also gets money by taxing some seniors on their monthly benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the number of seniors who are continuing to pay into the program is rising due to a combination of factors — one of which is that, while Social Security benefits get an annual cost-of-living adjustment, the thresholds for combined income have not been adjusted since 1993.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 2024 Congressional Research Service report (3) found that the overall share of Social Security benefits paid as federal income taxes rose from 2.2% in 1994 to 6.6% in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's estimated that about 50% of all Social Security recipients pay federal taxes on their benefits, but projections suggest more than 56% of Social Security recipients will pay taxes on benefits in 2050.\n",
      "\n",
      "That number is likely to keep rising if the combined income thresholds don’t adjust — assuming Trump doesn’t do away with taxes on Social Security altogether like he once suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to be clear, there’s a reason lawmakers never voted to raise the combined income thresholds. The goal was to eventually make it so that all seniors would pay taxes on their Social Security benefits so that the program could have a stronger ongoing revenue stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to an analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model (4), high-income seniors would stand to gain up to $100,000 in remaining lifetime welfare if taxes on Social Security were eliminated. Meanwhile, workers under 30 would be the biggest losers in this game, with households forgoing about $10,000 in lifetime welfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, eliminating taxes on Social Security could reduce government revenue by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, the Penn study found. And ending taxes on benefits would also deplete Social Security's trust funds by late 2032. A 2024 report by the Social Security Trustees previously put the combined trust fund depletion date at 2035 (5).\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s important because once Social Security’s trust funds run out of money, sweeping benefit cuts may become inevitable. Social Security is expected to lose a chunk of its payroll tax revenue as baby boomers retire in droves and an inadequate number of workers enter the labor force to replace them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aforementioned Congressional Research Service report found that in 2023, the Social Security trust funds were credited with $50.7 billion from the taxation of Social Security benefits, or 3.8% of the trust funds’ total income. While that’s a relatively small percentage, cutting any sort of revenue could be dangerous, given the program’s impending funding shortfall.\n",
      "\n",
      "When your financial circumstances hinge upon decisions over which you have no control, it’s important to take matters into your own hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bulking up your savings and investments is a good way to protect yourself from any impending changes to Social Security benefits. Another method is to diversify your portfolio to better resist market shocks by investing in alternative assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, with a gold IRA, you can invest in the inflation-hedging precious yellow metal while benefitting from a tax-advantaged account that helps you save for retirement. These accounts can give you the opportunity to hedge against market volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re interested in including more gold in your portfolio,Thor Metalscan help you get started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.\n",

      "Current projections expect about a 23% reduction in Social Security benefits once the program's trust funds run out of money. Trump's promise to end taxes on benefits would increase those cuts to 33% of benefits. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (6) also notes that eliminating taxes on benefits could result in benefit cuts happening as early as 2031.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because Social Security is already facing an alarming financial shortfall, lawmakers may be hesitant to approve a bill that results in the elimination of taxes on benefits.

      "\n",
      "Case in point, in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), passed by the House on July 4, Social Security taxes were not eliminated. Instead, the bill introduced a temporary $6,000 tax deduction until 2028 with income-based eligibility limits.\n",

      "The transaction will give Home BancShares’ subsidiary, Centennial Bank, entry to Tennessee for the first time and create an entity with roughly $25 billion in assets, $19.2 billion in deposits and $17 billion in loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "HomeBancSharesdisclosed in October that it had signed aletter of intentto buy a bank but did not name it. In an interview last month withAmerican Banker, the bank’s CEO, John Allison, stayed mum on the name but called the target a “good bank [with] good people” in “good markets” but that it had “problems” with unrealized losses on its balance sheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Centennial Bank counts branches in Arkansas, Texas, Florida, southern Alabama and New York City. The Mountain Commerce deal would give it seven new locations: four in the Tri-Cities area that encompasses Johnson City, Bristol and Kingsport (with a fifth slated to open by March), two around Knoxville and one in a Nashville suburb.\n",

      "“We look forward to being in these vibrant Tennessee markets,” Allison said in a statement. “We waited patiently to make our next acquisition to ensure we partnered up with a good quality bank in a strong market, and I am extremely pleased about what the future holds for HOMB and MCBI in the Volunteer State.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Home BancShares is a fairly frequent buyer – though its last acquisition, of Lubbock, Texas-based Happy State Bank in 2022, saw asset quality woes at the selling bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a conference in Nashville last month, Allison said he met with HoldCo Asset Management representatives and offered to serve as a buyer if the activist investor voiced issues with a lender in Home BancShares’ footprint.

The company most recentlydemanded management changes at KeyBank.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of Monday’s deal, Mountain Commerce shareholders will receive 0.85 shares of Home BancShares stock for each share they own. The transaction’s $150.1 million value stems from a volume-weighted average closing price per share of $27.66 for Home BancShares stock during the 20-trading-day span ending Friday. The deal implies a consideration value of $23.51 per share.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mountain Commerce is proud to join forces with one of the top-performing banks in the country,” the bank’s founder and CEO, Bill Edwards III, said in a statement. “This partnership provides resources, through HOMB’s strong balance sheet and capital position, to allow our talented team of bankers to flourish. There is a lot more work to be done in Tennessee to take advantage of the market opportunity and we are eager and ready to grow.”\n",

      "Spot rates rose 7% or $140 per forty foot equivalent unit in a short-term rebound in pricing after a bottoming out in late November.\n",
      "\n",
      "But rates remain lower by 32%, or $950 per FEU, according to an update from analysts Xeneta and eeSea, from early November as the market adjusts to earlier capacity and demand shifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The backdrop is still one of oversupply compared to demand and that is seen clearly in the fact rates are still not back to where they were a month ago despite a fairly chunky increase in the past week,” said Xeneta Chief Analyst Peter Sand. “Shippers should reflect on this weaker market the next time a carrier asks for a general rate increase (GRI), because it would not appear to be justified against the level of demand versus capacity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Spot rates are an important indicator for compiling rate indexes as shippers and carriers prepare for contract negotiations, which get fully underway in January.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the West Coast, offered capacity is flat to slightly down at 1%,indicating no meaningful tonnage expansion in the latest week. Capacity is up 7%, or 20,000 twenty foot equivalent units (TEUs) from November, as sharply lower pricing tracks higher supply despite the modest rate recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Week-on-week spot rates increased about 8%, or $220 per FEU, as the Asia-U.S. East Coast trade lane saw a short-term firming. Prices remain weaker by 21%, or $750 per FEU, than a month ago, a significant correction in that span with the latest improvement only a partial recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Capacity this past week was trimmed by 3% which helped boost rates, but was higher by 12%, or about 20,000 TEUs. Xeneta said the tentative stabilization contrasted with more ships and lower rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The setting was quite different in other tradelanes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Far East to North Europe currently shows both demand and supply strength,” said Sand, “carriers are adding capacity and rates are still edging up rather than softening.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said spot rate increases are even stronger from the Far East to the Mediterranean, with sustained double-digit growth over the past month as carriers reduce capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sand said the Asia-Europe trade could also be benefiting from developments around the Red Sea-Suez Canal route.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This shows carriers are warming up for a return to the region, but there are a number of steps to go through before this happens at a large scale and transits remain at low numbers compared to before the Red Sea crisis escalated,” he said.\n",

      "Fecha: 2025-12-08T13:00:00Z\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Imagine that you’re 65 years old and just completed a Roth conversion during a low-tax year early in retirement to avoid futurerequired minimum distributions(RMDs). However, not long after the conversion, you want to withdraw the money you just paid taxes on. But pursuing the withdrawal without first understanding the five-year rule for Roth IRAs could leave you paying income taxes and penalties on the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would the rule apply to you in this situation? Unfortunately, the answer is the ever unsatisfying “it depends.” In fact, there are actually several five-year rules to be aware of with Roth IRAs. We’ll review two that would likely come into play and explore how they would impact your withdrawal strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Need help planning your Roth conversion or navigating the five-year rule?Connect with a financial advisor today.\n",
      "\n",
      "The firstfive-year rule, which applies to Roth IRA contributions, centers around whether withdrawals of any accumulated earnings will be taxed. This rule requires the account owners to wait at least five tax years from the time of their first contribution – whether it was made directly or via conversion – to withdraw earnings, provided they have reached age 59 ½. If you make subsequent contributions or open new Roth accounts, the clock does not restart.\n",
      "\n",
      "For distributions of earnings to bequalified– that is, tax-free – you must satisfy the age requirement and this five-year rule. Exceptions to the age requirement exist for the death of the account owner, disabilities and first-time homebuyers. But even in the case of these exceptions, the five-year rule must be met or any earnings taken from the account will be taxable.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are at least 59 ½ years old but have not met the five-year rule requirement, then you will pay income taxes on any earnings that are withdrawn. Since contributions to Roth IRAs are made with after-tax dollars, you can always withdraw the value of your contributions free of taxes and penalties, but any gains generated and distributed before the five-year period ends will be taxed. The distribution would also be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are not 59 ½ years old. (Speak with a financial advisorif you need help navigating the five-year rule for your Roth IRA.)\n",
      "\n",
      "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second five-year rule relates specifically to Roth conversions and whether anearly withdrawalof converted principal will be taxed. In effect, the rule only applies if you take a distribution before you turn 59 ½.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, assume you have a Roth IRA in place and complete a conversion when you’re 56. If you want to withdraw that converted principal two years later at age 58, the withdrawal would be subject to the 10% early distribution penalty. However, if you wait until at least age 59 ½, you won’t face the penalty even though it will be less than five years since the conversion.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the five-year clock for the first rule starts with your initial Roth contribution, each Roth conversion you execute has its own five-year clock that starts on Jan. 1 of the year in which you complete the conversion. For example, if you do a Roth conversion in May 2024, your five-year clock would have started Jan. 1, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, you need to be mindful of your conversion history when taking distributions. The IRS helps you avoid potential mistakes to an extent by requiring contributions be withdrawn first, converted balances second and investment earnings last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, conversion withdrawals are done on a first-in, first-out basis, so the oldest conversions get withdrawn first once direct contributions have been fully distributed. (Need more help? Afinancial advisorcan help you better understand the withdrawal rules surrounding Roth conversions.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s apply each rule to the hypothetical scenario above to see why this case is not as straightforward as it might have seemed initially.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll start with the second rule since you’re over 59 ½ in our hypothetical example. As a result, you can withdraw all converted principal without paying a 10% penalty. The first rule is a bit trickier since its application will depend on the answers to a few questions. Specifically:\n",
      "\n",
      "If the conversion represents the first time you’ve put money in a Roth IRA, the first five-year rule would apply. That is, while you can withdraw the converted principal tax-free and penalty-free due to your age, you would still owetaxeson any investment earnings that you wish to take out. The key question then becomes how much you intend to distribute if the account has accumulated gains since its initial funding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s look at a few potential scenarios since we’re missing some key details to give a definitive answer. In each scenario, let’s assume you have $50,000 in the account post-conversion and that the conversion was in fact the initial funding of your first Roth IRA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scenario 1:You completed the conversion five days ago, the account has not generated any gains and you want to withdraw the account’s entire value. Since there are no earnings to distribute and the account value is simply the value of the conversion, the first rule is irrelevant. You can withdraw the whole account whenever you like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scenario 2:You completed the conversion a month ago, the account has generated $2,000 in gains and you want to withdraw $25,000. In this case, the first rule is also irrelevant since you are only tapping into the principal and not the earnings. Therefore, you can withdraw $25,000 in principal and not pay any taxes or penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scenario 3:Let’s assume the same background as Scenario 2, but you instead want to withdraw all $52,000 in the account. In this case, the first five-year rule applies since you have not waited five years to withdraw your earnings. Even though you are over 59 ½ years old, you would still owe taxes on the $2,000 in gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "A financial advisor can help you do the math specific to your circumstances.Get matched with a financial advisortoday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Application of these two five-year rules can become somewhat complex. Just remember that the first rule applies to earnings and the clock starts with your initial funding of the account. You cannot get around this rule even if you have reached age 59 ½. However, initial funding can come in the form of either a direct contribution or conversion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second five-year rule applies to money that’s converted into Roth assets. Although, this rule becomes moot if you’re at least 59 ½ years old, even if you withdraw converted funds less than five years after the conversion was completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "If aRoth IRAis part of yourretirementstrategy, the safest way to avoid confusion and an unanticipated tax bill is to start contributing early, take distributions only once you’ve reached age 59 ½ (if circumstances allow) and wait five years from initial funding before you start withdrawals.\n",

However, we did not foresee the pause in offshore spending that started in 2024. We do not expect a resumption of spending until 2027 at the earliest. In the meantime, companies like Noble Energy trade at ~10x Free cash flow, which is simply not as cheap if your cost of debt is 8% and your assets have a limited life span.
