Oracle is projected to report revenue of $16.21 billion for the period, up 15% from the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nAnd the tech firm\\'s closely watched AI segment, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), is expected to report a 68% climb in revenue to nearly $4.1 billion.\\n\\nOracle stock has plummeted 33% from a high of $328 in September, while the \"Magnificent Seven\" have cumulatively gained more than 11%, according to a Bloomberg index of the major tech stocks.\\n\\nOracle stock peaked this fall as Wall Street applauded the company\\'s massive, AI-fueled RPO, or remaining performance obligations — a measure of future revenue from customer contracts — whichjumped roughly 360%to $455 billion in the first quarter, driven by a $300 billion deal with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT).\\n\\nBut shares pulled back as Oracle\\'s heavy reliance upon OpenAI to reach itsambitious revenue targetsput investors on edge, given that the ChatGPT developer has taken oncostsfar in excess of itsprojected revenue.\\n\\nOracle has also centered in broader fears over an AI bubble, as investors grow concerned over the increasing use of debt to fund tech firms\\' data center projects, as well as the entanglement of companies participating in the AI boom through multibillion-dollarcircular financing arrangements.\\n\\nOracle had around $105 billion in total debt as of last quarter, issuing nearly $25.8 billion in corporate bonds this year alone as its investments in AI have soared.\\n\\nThe increasinguse of debtto fund capital spending in the AI race has shaken investors, raising concerns that the tech rally has relied too heavily on speculative future returns and pushed company valuations beyond what their fundamentals justify.\\n\\n\"ORCL [Oracle] has been the battleground for AI debt concerns,\" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a November note.\\n\\nOracle\\'s debt is perceived as riskier than that of its peers, with a BBB rating on its bonds, compared with Meta\\'s (META) and Amazon\\'s (AMZN) AA- and Alphabet\\'s (GOOGL) AA, according to Bloomberg composite ratings from major credit agencies.\\n\\nEarlier this month, the cost of insuring Oracle\\'s debt against default, as measured by its credit default swap pricing, climbed to its highest level since 2009, according to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) data shared with Yahoo Finance.\\n\\nOracle has taken on more debt just as its costs have grown.

She helped integrate Slack into the software company before Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff picked her as CEO in 2023.\\n\\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman earlier this month set off a “code red” alert in an internal email to employees to improve its flagship product, ChatGPT, and delay other product developments.\\n\\nOpenAI first released ChatGPT just over three years ago, sparking global fascination and a commercial boom in generative AI technology and giving the San Francisco-based startup an early lead. But the company faces increased competition with rivals, including Google, whichlast month unleashed Gemini 3, the latest version of its own AI assistant.\\n\\nAltman said this fall that ChatGPT now has more than 800 million weekly users.

OpenAIintroduced its own web browser, Atlas, in October, an attempt to compete with Google’s Chrome as more internet users rely on AI to answer their questions.

Farmers will begin receiving funds by the end of February, Rollins said.\\n\\n“Now we’re once again in a position where a president is able to put farmers first,” Trump said at a Monday roundtable of farmers and lawmakers. “But unfortunately, I’m the only president that does that.”\\n\\nWhile farmers and agricultural economists see the package as a way to move forward after a disappointing harvest season, they fear the precedent of cash bailouts does not provide systemic solutions to a beleaguered industry, and they don’t believe the $12 billion gesture is enough to solve agriculture’s deeper challenges.\\n\\n“We’re talking $12 billion, and while it is a lot of money, in the grand scheme of things, it’s still going to be a Band-Aid on a bigger wound,” Ryan Loy, assistant professor and extension economist for the University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture, toldFortune. “How can we triage this situation right now, work on that longer-term solution? That’s really, I think, the overall attitude toward it.”\\n\\nThe one-time payment program will send $11 billion to major row-crop producers growing corn, soybeans, and rice, and the remaining $1 billion will be reserved for specialty-crop growers, such as sugar. Trump said additional aid programs will depend on whether trade improves with China and other countries. While the money is welcome, farmers say they’d rather have the government secure stable markets and trade relations.\\n\\n“At the end of the day, the farmers, they just want to conduct business, not necessarily have to get these packages to help them out during these times,” Loy said.\\n\\nSince Trump introduced expansive import taxes—especially on China, provoking a wave of retaliatory tariffs—farmers have seen input costs increase while export demand and crop prices plummet.\\n\\n“It’s been a bit of a roller coaster in terms of not just uncertainty over our global markets and our prices, but also whether or not we were going to see any relief on the input side,” Kyle Jore, an economist, northwest Minnesota–based farmer, and secretary of the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, toldFortune.\\n\\nTariffs on farming-related machinery as well as products like seeds and fertilizer sit at 9%, costing U.S. farmers about $33 billion more, according to North Dakota State University’sAgricultural Trade Monitor. That includes a more than 15% tax on tractors and herbicides.\\n\\nSoybean farmers, responsible for the U.S.’s biggest agricultural export—which accounts for about14% of the country’s total cropssent overseas—have beenhit particularly hardby tariffs. Trade disputes with Beijing have disincentivized China from buying American soybeans, and the country has instead turned to South American countries like Argentina and especially Brazil, which makes up about71% of China’s soybean imports, according to the American Soybean Association.\\n\\nTo be sure,thawing relationsbetween the U.S. and China has enlivened soybean trade. China committed in October toresume ordersof U.S. soybeans after halting all purchases in May, promising to import 12 million tons of soybeans by the end of the year, as well asat least 25 million tonsin each of the next three years. However, soybean prices have still lagged because of stifled demand, and farmers saw theirthird straight year of losses, in large part due to tariff turmoil.\\n\\nAccording to agricultural economists, Trump’s farm aid program doesn’t hurt, but its benefits are limited: The bailout announcement arrived late in the harvest season, with farmers already booking orders at lower prices, nearly guaranteeing losses for the year. The package also doesn’t address input costs, which Jore sees as critical in improving tight margins.\\n\\n“A lot of farmers are making purchasing decisions on the ’26 year crop right now,” he said. “And the hope was that by now, we’d start to see some of the fertilizers and stuff come down, and it’s just not happening to the extent that we were hoping for.”\\n\\nJoe Maxwell, a Missouri farmer and cofounder and chief strategy officer of agriculture watchdog group Farm Action, said many of the issues plaguing the U.S. agriculture industry—including input costs—go beyond the trade disputes created by the Trump administration. His celebration of the bailout package was tempered by his belief the administration should be addressing policies that for years have been hurting the industry.\\n\\n“The message we’re wanting to get to Washington, D.C., is that the system is broke,” Maxwell toldFortune. “We need the financial support that the president has announced. But we need Congress to take a serious look at the structure of these programs, because it’s just failed.”\\n\\nWhile input costs have risen substantially from tariffs, Maxwell said the reason behind rising fertilizer and seed prices have more to do with corporate consolidations and monopolies dominating the input industry. According to Farm Action’sAgriculture Consolidation Data Hub, three fertilizer companies (CF Industries,Nutrien, and Koch) control 93% of North American nitrogen fertilizer sales in North America. Four seed companies (Bayer,Corteva,ChemChina, and BASF) similarly dominated 60% of the global seed market.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Trump signed anexecutive ordercreating a task force to investigate alleged antitrust practices impacting the cost of farming.\\n\\n“There is a disconnect from the fundamentals in the market, basic supply, demand,” Maxwell said. “One of the fundamentals is competition, and that does not exist in America’s agriculture.”\\n\\nMaxwell also noted Congressprovides subsidiesfor export crops, which he argued has created an oversupply problem. That exposes U.S. farmers, such as soybean producers, in instances like trade disputes when export demand plummets, he added. These subsidies also discourage American farmers from planting fruits and vegetables that would make the U.S. less reliant on exports and encourage crop diversification, which lends itself better to regenerative farming practices like crop rotation, which can decrease input costs and ultimately widen profits, Maxwell argued.\\n\\nThe USDA directedFortuneto its press release about the bailout program when asked for comment.\\n\\nUntil the government addresses the purported anticompetitive input industry and how subsidies may be exposing the agriculture industry in times of trade volatility, bailout packages will only go so far, Maxwell said.\\n\\n“If we don’t go after the antitrust violations that are there, and we don’t change the structure of our farm programs, we will not solve the financial crisis farmers are facing today,” he concluded.'}, {'title': 'Why AppLovin (APP) Stock Is Trading Up Today', 'published': '2025-12-09T16:20:59Z', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-applovin-app-stock-trading-162059454.html', 'content': \"Shares of mobile app technology company AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) jumped 3.6% in the morning session after the company provided a positive business update during its presentation at the Nasdaq 53rd Investor Conference.

Moreover, the investment aligns with New Delhi’s push toaccelerate digital infrastructure and AI adoptionacross sectors, as India looks to position itself as a global technology hub while addressing concerns around data governance and equitable access.\\n\\nThe announcement comes during Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s visit to India and follows his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, ahead of a keynote in New Delhi on Wednesday. The Redmond-based company also said it will open a new data center region in Hyderabad by mid-2026, its largest in India, comprising three availability zones — a footprint the company described as roughly the size of two Eden Gardens stadiums. Microsoft said it will continue expanding its three existing data-center regions in Chennai, Hyderabad, and Pune.\\n\\nAs part of the push, Microsoft also announced it will work with the Ministry of Labour and Employment to integrate advanced AI capabilities into two of its flagship digital public platforms — e-Shram and the National Career Service — to offer AI-driven services to more than 310 million informal workers.\\n\\nThe two Indian government platforms will use Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service to provide multilingual access, AI-assisted job matching, predictive analytics on skill and demand trends, automated résumé creation, and personalized pathways, the company said.\\n\\nMicrosoft also said it is rolling out new sovereign cloud options for Indian customers, including a Sovereign Public Cloud now available across its India regions and a Sovereign Private Cloud powered by Azure Local for both connected and air-gapped operations. The offerings would help enterprises meet regulatory and data-residency requirements and support high-performance workloads with access to the latest Nvidia GPUs and Microsoft 365 services, the company noted.\\n\\nAdditionally, Microsoft said its skilling efforts are also accelerating, noting that through its “ADVANTA(I)GE India” initiative, it has trained 5.6 million people since January — well ahead of its goal of training 10 million by 2030 — with the programs enabling more than 125,000 individuals to secure jobs or start businesses. The company is doubling its earlier commitment and now aims to equip 20 million Indians with basic AI skills by 2030, working with government agencies, industry partners, and digital public platforms to broaden access to training.\\n\\nMicrosoft’s investment commitment comes just months after Googleannounced a $15 billion planto build an AI hub and data-center infrastructure in India — the company’s largest investment in the country and one that follows itsearlier $10 billion pledgein 2020.\\n\\nIn the recent months, India has emerged as an especially attractive market for global tech companies as they look for regions to expand their AI footprint, drawn by the country’s vast base of internet subscribers, hundreds of millions of smartphone users, a fast-growing startup ecosystem, and the Indian government’s aggressive digitization agenda — all of which promise both consumer scale and enterprise demand. The push has accelerated this year, withOpenAIandAnthropicsetting up offices in India, andGoogleandPerplexitystriking partnerships with major telecom operators Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, respectively, to deepen their reach in the market.\\n\\nHowever, even as global tech firms ramp up investment, hyperscalers are expected toface significant constraintsin India, wheredata-center expansion is challengedbypatchy power availability, high energy costs, and water scarcity in several regions — factors that could slow the build-out of AI infrastructure and raise operating expenses for cloud providers.\\n\\nNonetheless, the Indian government has beenpushing aggressivelyto draw more big-tech investment, framing large-scale data-center and AI projects as central to its economic and digital-public-infrastructure ambitions. Despite the constraints, New Delhi has rolled out incentives for AI and semiconductor projects, eased some regulatory hurdles, and encouraged partnerships with domestic telecom and IT firms to anchor more of the global AI value chain in India.\\n\\n“Microsoft has been part of India’s fabric for more than three decades,” said Puneet Chandok, president, Microsoft India and South Asia, in a prepared statement. “As the nation moves confidently into its AI-first future, we are proud to stand as a trusted partner in advancing the infrastructure, innovation, and opportunity that can power a billion dreams.”\\n\\nMicrosoft already employs more than 22,000 people across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Gurugram, Noida, and other cities, including engineering teams that build AI products such as Copilot Studio, Azure AI Search, AI agents, speech and translation tools, and Azure Machine Learning for global markets, while also supporting the company’s domestic operations.'}]\n"
